			<h2>3D Maze Game</h2>
			
			<img src="../images/maze3d.png" class="screenshot">

			<p>
				This was a small and simple little game that I made in 2021 to test my knowledge of OpenGL. 
				
				<br><br>
			
				I made this a while back when I was learning the basics of OpenGL and I thought it would 
				be cool if I could create a simple little maze game that would display some of the things
				that I learned. I initially wanted the maze to be hand crafted but that proved too much work
				for just one level so I decided to instead procedurally generate the maze and after some work,
				I was able to get the maze generation to kind of work. I added some spinning yellow cubes that
				I called "coins" even though there is no score in the game and the coins are basically useless
				and generate only in dead ends. I had a decent amount of fun creating this project and you
				can browse the source code <a href="https://github.com/JLi69/3d-maze-game">here</a> and you
				can view the <a href="https://youtu.be/eIESb0ElVV8">gameplay video</a> along with the 
				<a href="https://youtu.be/w4pB5CD2FDo">code explanation video</a> on my YouTube.
				<br><br>

				Controls/Important Notes:<br>
				- Use the left/right/down/up arrow keys to move around <br>
				- The space bar can be used to jump and peek over the walls <br>
				- Find the spinning rainbow cube to beat the maze and new maze will be generated <br>
				<br>
				<strong class="highlight">Important:</strong> The folder "shaders" must be in the same 
				directory as the executable or there must at least be link to it.<br>
