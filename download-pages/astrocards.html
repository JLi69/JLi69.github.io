			<p> 
				This is a game that I made because I wanted to learn some basic
				Italian but needed a way to memorize vocabulary. I figured gamifying
				flashcards would be a fun short programming project and Astrocards
				is the result.<br>
				<br>
				Astrocards is mostly inspired by the Quizlet (I think it was Quizlet?)
				Asteroids game and I wanted to recreate it since last I checked
				I think Quizlet deleted that game.<br>
