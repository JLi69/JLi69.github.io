				This is a simple Godot Platformer that we worked
				on over the course of a couple weeks to learn how to use
				Godot collaboratively. It was a very fun game to work on
				and I liked how it turned out in the end. This project was
				written using GDScript and I learned quite a bit about Godot
				when making this project which I'm happy about. You can find
				the source code <a href="https://github.com/Birb-Games/birb-run">here</a>.

				<br><br>
				Controls:<br>
				- Left/Right arrows to move around<br>
				- Up arrow to jump<br>
				- You can also use the W, A, and D keys or a controller<br>
