			<p>
				A program that attempts to recreate the
				<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enigma_machine">enigma machine</a>
				that was used during WWII by the Germans. I made this as my final
				project for when I took AP European History in 2023 when we
				were supposed to give a brief presentation on something related
				to European History after the AP test.<br><br>

				I implemented rotors that you can manually set, a plugboard,
				and a keyboard where you can type your super secret message. The
				ciphertext then gets output to stdout because I was too lazy
				to actually program a gui for that.<br><br>

				For fun try decoding the following:
				<code>
