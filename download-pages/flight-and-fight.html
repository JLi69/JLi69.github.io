				This is a 3D arcade plane fighting game that I worked on for a
				couple of months. The basic idea is that you fly a fighter plane
				around and have to shoot down as many enemy planes as possible
				before you run out of health and crash. It's a simple gameplay
				loop but it's actually kind of fun. It was mostly meant to show
				off the tech from my <a href="infworld.html">infworld demo</a> but
				I was able to learn some more about other technology from this
				project such as how to use OpenAL to simulate 3D audio, how to build
				a UI with Nuklear (prior I was just making my own GUI code from
				scratch and while it kind of worked, I have to admit that I prefer
				having a library like Nuklear instead), and how to import obj models
				from Blender into a program (this project is the first game that
				I've made that has 3D models imported and I also learned Blender
				for this project as well). Overall, I'm really happy with how
				this project turned out.

				<strong>Controls</strong><br>
				 - Space Bar/Left Mouse Button - Shoot<br>
    			 - A, D - Turn<br>
    			 - S - Pitch up<br>
    			 - W - Pitch down<br>
    			 - Left Shift/Scroll up - Speed up<br>
    			 - Left Ctrl/Scroll down - Slow down<br>
				 - You can also move your mouse to rotate the plane<br>
				 &nbsp&nbsp- move mouse up = pitch up<br>
				 &nbsp&nbsp- move mouse down = pitch down<br>
				 &nbsp&nbsp- move mouse left = rotate left<br>
				 &nbsp&nbsp- move mouse right = rotate right<br>
    			 - T - toggle crosshair in fight mode<br>
				<br>
				<strong class="highlight">NOTE:</strong> The mouse is intended 
				for more fine adjustments to your plane's rotation (such as 
				targeting or course correction), if you are trying to make larger 
				changes in rotation then I would recommend using the keyboard 
				as if you just use the mouse you're probably going to have a bad time.<br>
				<br>
