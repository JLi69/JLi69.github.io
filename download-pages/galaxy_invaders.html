			<p>
				This is a simple game that is sort of a Space Invaders / Galaga clone 
				but the enemies can be scripted using Lua. I made this just to test my
				knowledge of the Lua programming language and if I can integrate it 
				into a C program (like a simple game). There are 15 waves and a final boss
				fight along with a bunch of randomly generated waves after that 
				(though a lot of those are pretty much downright unfair to play, be warned).
				Source code available at 
				<a href="https://github.com/JLi69/galaxy_invaders">here</a> under the MIT
				license.
				<br><br>
				If for whatever reason you wish to mod the game, be warned that I did not
				include proper error checking / handling and a lot of stuff is just
				hacked together and perhaps not particularly well designed.
