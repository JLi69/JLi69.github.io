			<p>
				This is a 3D game that I made in OpenGL that is inspired by the popular mobile game 
				<a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/geometry-dash/id625334537">Geometry Dash</a>. 
				<br><br>
				
				I made this game to test my skills with OpenGL as I have learned how to use textures
				in OpenGL and also I learned how to use mutliple models in OpenGL as well. I
				therefore made this game to test my knowledge that I have learned. Additionally,
				the <a href="https://github.com/JLi69/geodash3">game</a> and 
				<a href="https://github.com/JLi69/geodash3/tree/master/editor">editor</a> are open source
				on GitHub and are licensed under GPLv2. Also just for fun, I added some sound
				files generated using <a href="https://www.drpetter.se/project_sfxr.html">sfxr</a>
				which are played using the library 
				<a href="https://github.com/kcat/openal-soft">openal-soft</a>.<br><br>

				Controls/Important Notes:<br>
				- Use A/D to move the player cube left and right<br>
				- Use the space bar to jump<br>
				- To move around in the editor use the W,A,S, and D keys <br>
				- Use Space/Shift to move up and down in the editor <br>
				- To rotate the camera in the editor, use the mouse <br>
				- To place an object in the editor, use the right click button and to destroy
				something, use the left click button. <br>
				- To enter "view" mode in the editor press "1" and to enter the "edit" mode in
				the editor press "2" <br>
				- Use the scroll wheel in the editor to change the current item you are going 
				to place down <br>
				- Use CTRL+E to save the level to a file <br>
				- Press the ESCAPE key to pause the game or editor

				<br>
				<b class="highlight">Important:</b> The folder "res" must be in the same directory as
				the executable or there must at least be link to it.<br>
