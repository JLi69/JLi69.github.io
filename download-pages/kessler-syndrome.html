			<h2>Kessler Syndrome</h2>

				This is a game my friend gldeA and I made for the 2025 GMTK Game
				Jam, which had the theme of "Loop". In <em>Kessler Syndrome</em>,
				you control a satellite that orbits a planet that has to destroy
				other satellites/probes that are also orbiting the planet. 
				If you think about it, an orbit is just a giant loop in space so
				that's how we integrated the theme into the project.
				You also have to avoid various hazards such as asteroids and moons.
				My friend gldeA made the music, I made the artwork, and we worked
				together on the code.
				<br><br>
				As for the game's name, it is named after a theoretical
				disaster (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kessler_syndrome">wikipedia</a>)
				in which a satellite is destroyed and the debris from said
				satellite damages other satellites and causes a chain reaction
				that makes it impossible to send any more satellites or missions
				into space. Since the game is about destroying alien satellies and
				probes, that probably is a somewhat appropriate title. It also
				just sounds like a cool name.
