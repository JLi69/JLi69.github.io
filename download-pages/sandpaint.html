				Simple falling sand simulation written in Rust.
				
				<br><br>
				
				This is a simple falling sand simulation that I wrote over the
				course of a few days for fun. There are multiple types of sand
				that can interact with each other for some interesting reactions.
				There are likely some bugs and incorrect behaviors in the sand
				and the program could use some optimization as well. 
				However, it's still kind of fun to mess around with the
				different types of sand.  I might expand/improve this
				program in the future.

				Controls:<br>
				- Space bar to pause/unpause the simulation<br>
				- Left click to place sand<br>
				- Scroll wheel to change the size of the brush<br>
