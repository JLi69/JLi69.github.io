			<p> 
				This is a game that I wrote for the 2023 Github Game Off Jam
				over the course of the month of November.

				<br><br>
				
				This is a fun little platformer that I wrote over the course of
				a month using the Rust Programming Language. I decided to
				experiment with using OpenGL with Rust. I decided to attempt
				to combine 3D graphics with 2D style graphics and I really
				like how it turned out in the end. The source code is available
				<a href="https://github.com/JLi69/scale-the-tower">here</a>
				under the Apache 2.0 License. However, note that the code 
				isn't very well written in many places and many parts probably 
				could not be considered "idiomatic" Rust in many parts as well.
				However, this game was hacked together over the course of a
				month so please forgive me for the code quality.
				
				<br><br>

				Controls/Important Notes:<br>
				 - Left/Right Arrows: Move around <br>
				 - Up Arrow: Jump <br>
				 - Space: Attack <br>
				 - 1/2: Sword/Bow <br>
