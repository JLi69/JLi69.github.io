			<p> 
				This is a simple game that I made for the 2023 GMTK game jam
				using <a href="https://www.love2d.org/">LÃ–VE</a> and the Lua
				programming language. The theme was "Roles Reversed" and I
				therefore came up with the idea that rather than play a Sokoban
				player pushing around blocks, you instead played as a box that
				pushed around and squished humans and that was how this game
				was created.<br><br>

				The game is kind of buggy and the controls are a little
				troublesome at times but I have included source code if you are
				interested in looking at it (the source code is of questionable
				quality so be warned of that). Consider the code to be under
				the MIT License.
				
				<br><br>

				Controls/Important Notes:<br>
				 - Left/Right/Down/Up Arrows: Charge up "dash" and release
				 to move<br>
				 - Keep an eye on how many moves you have left for the level!<br>
				 - Avoid getting pushed onto the red Xs!<br>
