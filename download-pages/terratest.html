			<p>
				Clone of Terraria written in C. Game is open source under MIT license, you can browse
				source code <a href="https://github.com/JLi69/terratest">here</a>. I made this during
				my sophomore year of high school (2022- 2023) and I'm mostly happy with how the game
				looks.

				<br><br>
				<strong>UPDATE July 23, 2024:</strong> I have decided to abandon
				this project as I haven't really worked on it in a long time and
				the code for it is just a tangle of unmaintainable spaghetti code -
				there are also way too many issues with the game as well that I
				am not particularly happy with.
				<br><br>
				For more detailed thoughts on why I decided to abandon this
				project you can read 
				<a href="https://jli69.github.io/blog/2024/07/23/criticizing-terratest.html">this blog post</a>.
				<br><br>
				The project will still remain available for download - I might
				make a rewrite in the future but that likely won't happen for
				some time.

				<br><br>
				Controls:<br>
				- A,D to move around<br>
				&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp- Space to jump<br>
				&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp- W,S to climb a ladder<br>
				- Tab to open crafting menu<br>
				&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp- Up/Down arrows to scroll through crafting menu<br>	
				&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp- Enter to craft item<br>
				- Right click to place blocks<br>
				- Left click to break blocks/attack enemies<br>
				- Scroll wheel to move through inventory<br>
