			<h2>C-Tetris "Tetromino Game"</h2>
			
			<img src="../images/ctetris-screenshot.png" class="screenshot">

			<p>
				This is a quick little Tetris clone that I made using C (Hence the name, C-Tetris)
				and OpenGL. 
				
				<br><br>
				
				I originally made this game for fun and also as a little challenge (I wanted to test
				my OpenGL knowledge and I was more used to C++ rather than C). It was difficult at 
				times but I am very happy with the way the final product turned out. The code is also
				open-source on <a href="https://github.com/JLi69/tetromino-game">GitHub</a>
				and you are free to use my code for any purpose and I don't have any conditions
				on what you can or cannot do with it (however, credit would be appreciated and
				I would also love to see any improvements or new features you add to my code).
				<br><br>

				Controls/Important Notes:<br>
				- Use the left/right arrow keys to move the tetromino around. <br>
				- The space bar can be used to do a hard drop on the current tetromino. <br>
				<br>
				<strong class="highlight">Important:</strong> The folder "shaders" must be in the same 
				directory as the executable or there must at least be link to it.<br>
