			<h2>Totally Historically Accurate D-Day Simulator (THADDaySim)</h2>

			<p>
				This is a game that I made with Godot - it's themed around the
				Allied landings at Normandy during D-Day so there are two sides:
				Allies and Axis. The Allies are trying to get to the end of the
				map and capture the Axis flag while the Axis are trying to stop
				them - the game is meant to be played with two players. It's
				kind of like a "digital board game" in a way.
