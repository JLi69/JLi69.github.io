			<h2>The Server Must Scale</h2>
			
			<img src="../images/the-server-must-scale.jpg" class="screenshot">

			<p>Made with <a href="https://github.com/gldeA">gldeA</a> and <a href=https://github.com/cfinn68916>cfinn</a></p>

			<p>
				This is the game that gldeA, cfinn, and I worked on for the 2024
				GMTK Game Jam and we made it over the course of 96 hours. The
				theme of the jam was "built to scale". We decided to interpret it
				as "scaling up" in software development where you have to build
				a program to be able to handle more and more data and we figured
				a good representation of this would be a factory style game where
				you had to manage a server farm and build it to be as efficient
				as possible in order to keep up with the ever increasing amount
				of input data. Overall, it was very fun to work on this and I
				liked how the end result looks.

				<br><br>
				Controls:<br>
				 - W, A, S, D = pan camera<br>
				 - Scroll = zoom in/out<br>
				 - Left click = place tile<br>
				 - Right click = rotate tile<br>
				 - Shift + Right click = reverse rotation<br>
				 - Space = Pause the game (You can still build in pause mode)<br>
				 - Escape = Quit session<br>
				 - Q = deselect whatever tile you currently have selected<br>
