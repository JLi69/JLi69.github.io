			<h2>C-Tetris "Tetromino Game"</h2>
			<h3>
				This is a quick little Tetris clone that I made using C (Hence the name, C-Tetris) and OpenGL. <br><br>
				
				I originally made this game for fun and also as a little challenge (I wanted to test my OpenGL knowledge and I was more used to C++ rather than C). It was difficult at times but I am very happy with the way the final product turned out. The code is also open-source on <a href="https://github.com/JLi69/tetromino-game">GitHub</a> and you are free to use my code for any purpose and I don't have any conditions on what you can or cannot do with it (however, credit would be appreciated and I would also love to see any improvements or new features you add to my code).<br><br>

				Controls/Important Notes:<br>
				- Use the left/right arrow keys to move the tetromino around. <br>
				- The space bar can be used to do a hard drop on the current tetromino. <br>
				<br>
				<b class="highlight">Important:</b> The folder "shaders" must be in the same directory as the executable or there must at least be link to it.<br>

			<h2>GeoDash-3D [DEMO]</h2>
			<h3>
				This is a 3D game that I made in OpenGL that is inspired by the popular mobile game "Geometry Dash". <br><br>
				
				This is a game that I am currently working on (as of this writing) and there are currently only 2 basic levels. I am making this game to test my skills with OpenGL as I have learned how to use textures in OpenGL (however, there are currently no textures in the game yet) and also I learned how to use mutliple models in OpenGL as well. I am making this game to test my knowledge that I have learned. However, the <a href="https://github.com/JLi69/geodash3">game</a> and <a href="https://github.com/JLi69/geodash3-editor">editor</a> are open source on GitHub and are licensed under GPLv2. Also note that this is a demo and the project is still a WIP. Feedback/criticism is welcome and appreciated.<br><br>

				Controls/Important Notes:<br>
				- Use A/D to move the player cube left and right<br>
				- Use the space bar to jump<br>
				- To move around in the editor use the W,A,S, and D keys <br>
				- Use Space/Shift to move up and down in the editor <br>
				- To rotate the camera in the editor, use the mouse <br>
				- To place an object in the editor, use the right click button and to destroy something, use the left click button. <br>
				- To enter "view" mode in the editor press "1" and to enter the "edit" mode in the editor press "2" <br>
				- Use the scroll wheel in the editor to change the current item you are going to place down <br>
				- Use CTRL+E to save the level to a file <br>

				<br>
				<b class="highlight">Important:</b> The folder "res" must be in the same directory as the executable or there must at least be link to it.<br>
