				Freckles was a Boston Terrier that my family had and he was the
				most loyal dog you can ever hope to have. He loved people and
				was soft, cuddly, warm, and loved being hugged. He loved eating
				and enjoyed whatever snacks we gave him. He loved dog treats,
				strawberries, bananas, apples, and rotisserie chicken. It was
				a joy to feed him these snacks and whenever he thought we 
				were eating something he would beg for a treat as well and we
				would usually give it to him. He grew rather big due to how
				many snacks he consumed. Freckles wasn't the biggest on exercise
				and at times just preferred to stay indoors but he did enjoy 
				chasing rabbits around in the backyard during the summer. 
				However, whenever we would go outside he would bark, wanting to 
				come outside with us. However, he would quickly return home after a 
				few minutes when he decided he had enough fresh air. 
				Freckles would never hurt anyone, he would usually never bite a human. 
				He did bark a lot though. He was always there to greet me when
				I came home from school.
				<br><br>
				However, Freckles would in his later life experience seizures
				and in February of 2024 became quite ill. He lost his appetite
				and started pacing around the house without rest. We tried to
				feed him and have him drink water but eventually he would start
				refusing food. He lost weight and eventually started having
				trouble breathing. On February 22, 2024, Freckles passed
				away.
				<br><br>
				The house is empty and quiet without him and it feels as if I
				have massive hole in my heart. This page was created as a tribute
				to immortalize this faithful furry friend.
				<br><br>
				Freckles lived a good life, he had many snacks and received many
				hugs and got to bark a lot. He wasn't the most obedient at times
				but we still loved him. I miss him and I hope he is in a better
				place, where he can eat all the snacks he wants and lie in
				the sun for as long as he wants and will never ever experience
				any more pain. 
				<br><br>
				I love you Freckles,
				and I will love you until the end of time &lt;3.

			<h3>Rest In Peace Freckles, June 13, 2015 - February 22, 2024</h3>

			<p>
				I have included pictures of him throughout his life and hopefully
				this will be preserved for a long time.
