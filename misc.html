			<h2>Mandelbrot Set Program in 190 characters</h2>	

			<p>
				<strong>
					<code>
						#define l(v)for(float v=-2;v<=2;v+=.1f)<br>
						int main(){l(i){l(r){float a=0,b=0;int v=16;while(v>0){float t=a*a-b*b+r;b=2*a*b+i;a=t;if(t*t+b*b>4)v=0;--v;}v?printf(".."):printf("##");}puts("");}}
					</code>
				</strong>

				I was bored one day and decided to waste some time trying to
				code golf a C program that could output the Mandelbrot Set
				to stdout. As far as I've tested, this compiles under
				<code>gcc 11.4.0</code> on Ubuntu.<br><br>

				Copy and paste the code and try it out yourself! :D<br>

			<h2>Prime Sieve in 126 characters</h2>	

			<p>
				<strong>
					<code>
						#define l for(i=2;i&lt;N;i++)<br>
						int N=1000001,i,j;main(){int b[N];l b[i]=1;l{if(b[i]){printf("%d\n",i);for(j=i;j&lt;N;j+=i)b[j]=0;}}}
					</code>
				</strong>
				<br><br>

				This is a prime sieve written in C that outputs all the primes between 
				1 and 1000000 in only 126 bytes of source code. You can technically
				shave off a few more bytes by removing the newline and instead
				having a space be output (but reading the output is harder in
				my opinion). Additoinally, you can shave off 2 more bytes by
				removing the brackets from the <code>if(b[i])</code> statement
				so that only the <code>printf</code> function is in the if statement.
				The program still produces the same output but is slightly less
				performant so I decided to keep the brackets. But technically
				you can get this program down to 123 bytes. Additionally, you
				can remove some digits from N to decrease the character count some
				more. As far as I've tested, this compiles under <code>gcc 13.3.0</code> 
				on Ubuntu.<br><br>
