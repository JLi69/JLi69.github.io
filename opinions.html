			<h2>Opinions</h2>

			<p>
				Here are some opinions that I believe in (political and
				nonpolitical). If you disagree with me, that is totally okay!
				We can still be friends :)
			</p>

			<h3>Technology</h3>

			<p>
				&gt; Free and Open Source is the correct way to develop software<br>
				&gt; User freedom should be valued by developers<br>
				&gt; Privacy is a human right<br>
				&gt; Proprietary software should be avoided by users<br>
				&gt; Windows 10/11 are bad operating systems<br>
				&gt; JavaScript is used too much in the modern web<br>
				&gt; Programs should aim to be simple and bloat free<br>
				&gt; Internet censorship is evil<br>
				&gt; Silicon Valley kind of sucks<br>
				&gt; Piracy is moral<br>
				&nbsp; &gt; It is still illegal, so you should not do it. <br>
				&nbsp; &gt; However, DRM is harmful and should be abolished. <br>
				&nbsp; &gt; Overall, copyright is very broken and needs to be fixed <br>
				&nbsp; &gt; "Piracy is an issue of service, not price" - Gabe Newell <br>
				&nbsp; &gt; See also: <a href="https://xkcd.com/488/">https://xkcd.com/488/</a> <br>
				&gt; Adblockers are moral (see: <a href="https://www.ic3.gov/Media/Y2022/PSA221221?=8324278624">https://www.ic3.gov/Media/Y2022/PSA221221?=8324278624</a>)<br>
				&gt; Java sucks<br>
				&gt; AI generated art is soulless.<br>
			</p>

			<h3>Politics</h3>
			<p>
				&gt; Both the Democratic Party and Republican Party suck.<br>
				&gt; The government should be somewhat limited in power<br>
				&gt; The government should not spy on its citizens<br>
				&gt; We need stronger privacy regulations<br>
				&gt; The Electoral College sucks<br>
				&gt; The government should invest more into public transit<br>
				&gt; Most of the time, you shouldn't trust the FBI/CIA/NSA<br>
				&gt; The government needs to work more towards stopping climate
				change<br>
				&gt; Free speech and Freedom of Religion are very important<br>
				&gt; Government should be seperated from religion<br>
				&gt; All religions (cults like Scientology don't count) are
				valid on some way and should all be accepted and respected<br>
			</p>

			<h3>LGBTQ</h3>
			<p>
				I consider myself to be a straight male but these are
				my opinions on LGBTQ issues:<br><br>

				&gt; Gay Marriage should be legitimate and legal<br>
				&gt; LGBTQ potrayal in media is good<br>
				&gt; You should respect people's pronouns<br>
				&gt; Accepting transgender people is good for society<br>
				&gt; Being gay is natural<br>
				&gt; The LGBTQ community should have the right to express
				themselves and be proud of who they are<br>
			</p>

			<h3>China</h3>

			<p>
				For the record, I am of Chinese descent and I am proud of my
				culture but that doesn't mean I can't criticize the Chinese
				government.<br><br>

				&gt; The Chinese Communist Party is an evil and corrupt 
				government<br>
				&gt; The Great Firewall is evil<br>
				&gt; Stop the occupation of Tibet!<br>
				&gt; Free Xinjiang and stop the Uyghur Genocide!<br>
				&gt; Free Hong Kong and Macau!<br>
				&gt; Taiwan is effectively an independent country, no matter
				how much the CCP wants to gaslight everyone.<br>
				&gt; The CCP unjustly bullies other Asian nations<br>
				&gt; China needs a democratic government<br>
			</p>

			<h3>Other</h3>

			<p>
				&gt; Pineapple on Pizza is a terrible idea<br>
				&gt; Noodles are better than Spaghetti<br>
				&gt; Noodles are one of the best foods ever created.<br>
				&gt; Public School teachers are underpaid and should be compensated more<br>
				&gt; You should support Indie Game Developers :)<br>
				&gt; Learning a foreign language is a good idea<br>
