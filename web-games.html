			<h2>Web Games</h2>
			
			<p>
				These are a few web games that I made with JavaScript when I was bored
				during my freshman year of high school. Most of these aren't really that
				good and the JavaScript is a complete mess. I'm not a JavaScript
				developer and I personally don't actually like JavaScript that much as a
				programming language.

				But the school Chromebooks had a text editor and the only programming
				language that I could mess around with was JS (I could use Google Chrome
				to run my stuff).
				<br><br>	
				Most of these games were made to be played with two people using the same
				computer (usually one person uses arrow keys while the other uses WASD)
				as I meant to play these games with some friends when I had nothing to do
				or was bored in class (to be honest I was never good at these games and
				actually usually lost most of the time which might say something about
				my ability to play video games).
				<br><br>
				However, these games can be fairly buggy at times and weren't really
				designed well (I was using a Chromebook at school so these are designed
				for Google Chrome though Firefox seems to work just fine). Source code
				is also available for download and you may use it for whatever purpose
				you want (for those who care, consider the code
				<a href="https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/public-domain/cc0/">CC0 Licensed.</a>) 
				Development became kind of painful after IT at my high school
				figured out how to block inspect element (or were ordered to by the
				school, it wasn't blocked until my freshman year). That was quite annoying
				and I didn't particularly like JS as a programming language so I don't
				intend on making any more of these games in the future. However, I might
				clone some of these into C/C++ and make them into desktop applications
				for fun.

				This is a small game that I made where you attempt to capture the flag of the
				other player. I made this when I was bored in class and I am kind of happy
				with how it turned out. It is fairly buggy at times (you can noclip through
				the walls if you try hard enough and there are some issues with player
				control). The game's graphics aren't very good but dark gray blocks are walls,
				brown blocks can be destroyed, and red blocks explode. If you lose all of your
				health, you get sent back to your spawn point and if you were carrying the
				opponent's flag then you drop it. If you lose your flag you can no longer
				heal in the game. The first one to 5 flags captured wins. Move the blue
				player with the arrow keys and shoot with the down arrow. Move the red
				player with WASD and use S to shoot.

			<h2><a href="web-games/race/race.html">Racing Game</a></h2>

				This is a simple little racing game that I made when I was bored in class.
				Control the red car with the arrow keys and control the blue car with WASD.
				Complete a lap to get a point and if you collect the protein powder you get
				a speed boost (don't question it, someone suggested it as a joke and I
				decided to implement it as I had nothing better to do with my time). If you
				run over the banana, you wipe out. Try to stay on the road as the grass slows
				you down. You can collide with the other car and this can lead to you losing
				health and if your health goes to 0, you wipe out. The game has a decent
				amount of bugs that cause it to break at times but I can't be bothered to fix
				them now.
