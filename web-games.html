			<h2>Web Games</h2>
			
			<p>
				These are a few web games that I made with JavaScript when I was bored
				during my freshman year of high school. Most of these aren't really that
				good and the JavaScript is a complete mess. I'm not a JavaScript
				developer and I personally don't actually like JavaScript that much as a
				programming language.

				But the school Chromebooks had a text editor and the only programming
				language that I could mess around with was JS (I could use Google Chrome
				to run my stuff).
				<br><br>	
				Most of these games were made to be played with two people using the same
				computer (usually one person uses arrow keys while the other uses WASD)
				as I meant to play these games with some friends when I had nothing to do
				or was bored in class (to be honest I was never good at these games and
				actually usually lost most of the time which might say something about
				my ability to play video games).
				<br><br>
				However, these games can be fairly buggy at times and weren't really
				designed well (I was using a Chromebook at school so these are designed
				for Google Chrome though Firefox seems to work just fine). Source code
				is also available for download and you may use it for whatever purpose
				you want (for those who care, consider the code
				<a href="https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/public-domain/cc0/">CC0 Licensed.</a>) 
				Development became kind of painful after IT at my high school
				figured out how to block inspect element (or were ordered to by the
				school, it wasn't blocked until my freshman year). That was quite annoying
				and I didn't particularly like JS as a programming language so I don't
				intend on making any more of these games in the future. However, I might
				clone some of these into C/C++ and make them into desktop applications
				for fun.
