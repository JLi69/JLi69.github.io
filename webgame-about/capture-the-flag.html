				This is a small game that I made where you attempt to capture the flag of the
				other player. I made this when I was bored in class and I am kind of happy
				with how it turned out. It is fairly buggy at times (you can noclip through
				the walls if you try hard enough and there are some issues with player
				control). The game's graphics aren't very good but dark gray blocks are walls,
				brown blocks can be destroyed, and red blocks explode. If you lose all of your
				health, you get sent back to your spawn point and if you were carrying the
				opponent's flag then you drop it. If you lose your flag you can no longer
				heal in the game. The first one to 5 flags captured wins. Move the blue
				player with the arrow keys and shoot with the down arrow. Move the red
				player with WASD and use S to shoot.
