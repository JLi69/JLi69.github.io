				This is a simple little racing game that I made when I was bored in class.
				Control the red car with the arrow keys and control the blue car with WASD.
				Complete a lap to get a point and if you collect the protein powder you get
				a speed boost (don't question it, someone suggested it as a joke and I
				decided to implement it as I had nothing better to do with my time). If you
				run over the banana, you wipe out. Try to stay on the road as the grass slows
				you down. You can collide with the other car and this can lead to you losing
				health and if your health goes to 0, you wipe out. The game has a decent
				amount of bugs that cause it to break at times but I can't be bothered to fix
				them now.
